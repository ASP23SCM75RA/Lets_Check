 ## About 
 
Welcome to the social media profile checker! With this script, you can quickly and easily find out if a user has a presence on various social media platforms. Simply enter the username you want to check, and the number of social media profiles you want to retrieve (between 1 and 20). The script will then use the social-scan API to search for the user and display the resulting social media profiles.

Not only is this script super helpful for finding out more about a person online, it's also really fun to use. Just run the script and let it do the work for you. No need to be a tech expert - anyone can use it!

This script requires the requests and json libraries, as well as the shutil library for terminal size detection. Give it a try and see what you can find out about your friends, family, or even celebrities. Happy searching!
